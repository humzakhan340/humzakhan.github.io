I'm trying to keep track of what I read. I'm smart enough to annotate my books and write when I start and finish them, but too dumb to have written down what books I've read. 

**What I'm Reading**
* The Stranger by Camus (Re-reading)

**What I Want to Read**
* Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman (sorely overdue)
* Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky
* 

**What I've Read in 2020**
* The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera
* The Island of Dr. Moreau by H.G. Wells
* No Time to Lose by Peter Piot (This book discusses several pandemics. While incredibly interesting, I got 300 pages in until I realized it made me more anxious about COVID and gave up on it)
* Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut
* The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down by Anne Fadiman
* How We Do Harm by Otis Brawley and Paul Goldberg
