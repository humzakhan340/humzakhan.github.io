I have a commitment to work across the research spectrum--from basic science studies to clinical data analysis. Generally, though, my heart lies in the lab. 

At some indeterminate time in the future, I plan on applying to MD-PhD programs.

**Basic and Translational Research**
======

I entered the Butte laboratory in my freshman year of college. I floundered around for a few months, trying to figure out how to use a pippete, before I became somewhat useful.

Then, I spent some time working on a potential allergy diagnostic called the Basophil Activation Test. I spent about six months on this project. The test wasn't reliable across control donors, so we scrapped it. During this time, I mentored Ilan Bocian, a high school student who is now a freshman at Yeshiva University in New York.  

After the BAT, I transitioned and began working with Tim Thauland, a staff scientist in our lab, on a project linking alpha-adducin, an actin-capping protein, to T cell costimulation. Our work showed a novel link between the cytoskeleton and complete activation of helper T cells. 

At the same time, Manish introduced me to Cytometry by Time of Flight (CyTOF). Using some fantastic physics, CyTOF enables the single cell measurement of 35+ cellular proteins at once. I am utilizing this technology to study cell signaling in all known circulating immune cells of healthy donors and patients with Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). 

CVID patients are incredibly heterogenous; most suffer primarily infectious complications, with a subset of patients also experiencing autoimmunity and other dysregulations. Patients with non-infectious complications have a significantly (read: 10x) higher risk of death than patients without these complications. 

Our work is trying to understand signaling patterns in these autoimmune patients so that they can be treated more aggressively, earlier, and hopefully for the better. 

CyTOF data happens to be incredibly high dimensional. Every experiment I run generates over 2 gigabytes of data. For this reason, I started applying data science tools to my ever-expanding dataset. This involves data cleaning, automated sub-population mean extraction via Gaussian mixture models, and batch effects correction.

The analysis pipeline that I'm creating will (hopefully) be released as an R package for general analysis of CyTOF signaling data.

If you are interested in the science, I'm flattered. For further reading, my undergraduate thesis is attached here. 

**Clinical Work**
======

Assessing Residents' CI-CARE is an organization that partners with the David Geffen School of Medicine to evaluate resident physicians through surveys. I joined this organization as a freshman in college and volunteered as a surveyer for two years. During this time, I began to assume leadership roles, particularly in the clinical research branch of our organization. 

Our organization wanted to utilize the data that we collected to ensure that residents were improving as they continued their training. It turned out that they were, woohoo! 

I also wanted to critically assess which departments communicated particularly well with their patients and which were below average. Unsurprisingly, pediatricians performed staggeringly above average in terms of communication. Surgical specialties needed extra support.  

I performed statistical analysis and helped coordinate our teams for both of these projects.
